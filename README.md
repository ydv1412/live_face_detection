 On the road to the digital world, human-computer interaction is
 becoming very important. Much research has been done in this area over
 the last decade. Facial expressions are an important feature of nonverbal
 communication and play an important role in human-computer
 interaction. This project introduces a facial expression recognition (FER)
 approach using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Created with
 CNN, this model can be used to detect facial expressions in real time.
 This system can be used to analyze emotions while a user is watching a
 movie trailer or video lecture other than that also for small children in
 the classroom attending class.
